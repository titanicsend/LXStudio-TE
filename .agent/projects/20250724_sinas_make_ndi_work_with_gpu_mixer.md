### Task 1.3 - âœ… **COMPLETED** - Add comprehensive logging to NDI output

- **Implementation:** Enhanced `NDIOutRawEffect.java` with detailed logging:
  - Initialization tracking and resolution reporting
  - Frame count and performance metrics (FPS calculation)
  - Color data validation and buffer status monitoring
  - NDI sender state and error reporting
  - Memory usage tracking for the 9.2MB video buffer
- **Build Optimization:**
  - Documented Maven workflow: avoid `mvn clean`, use `mvn compile` for iterations
  - Created comprehensive Maven documentation at `.agent/specs/03_mvn.md`
  - Successful incremental build: 3.4s compile + 1m20s package time

### Task 1.4 - âœ… **COMPLETED** - Launch TE app with GPU support and verify NDI initialization

- **Launch Success:** GPU-enabled TE app launched successfully with parameters:
  ```bash
  java -ea -XstartOnFirstThread -Djava.awt.headless=true -Dgpu \
    -jar target/te-app-0.3.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar \
    --resolution 1920x1200 Projects/BM2024_TE.lxp
  ```
- **Key Observations:**
  - **GPU Rendering:** BGFX renderer: Metal (native macOS GPU acceleration)
  - **NDI Initialization:** `NDIOutRawEffect: Created with resolution 1920x1200, buffer size: 9216000 bytes`
