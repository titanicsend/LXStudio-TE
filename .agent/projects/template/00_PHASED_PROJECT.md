# Project Implementation Plan

Review these specifications and all referenced documentation:

    - .agent/specs/00_codex.md
    - ###{Include additional specifications as needed}###

Create detailed implementation plan for each phase, develop comprehensive task lists, and execute tasks systematically. Document progress updates directly alongside task descriptions.

## CRITICAL: Documentation Quality Standards

**ESSENTIAL**: Handle this project document as a professional design specification. When maintaining this document:

- **Ensure clarity and organization** - This document serves as the authoritative design record
- **Consider future maintainers** - Others will reference this to understand project implementation
- **Explain technical decisions** - Document rationale behind architectural choices
- **Track progress systematically** - Update task status as work proceeds
- **Preserve implementation history** - Keep record of completed work for reference

## Implementation Context and Scope
