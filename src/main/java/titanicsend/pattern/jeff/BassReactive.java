/**
 * One of our pattern standards is that the pattern should be audio-reactive,
 * even without accurate tempo data present from an external clock or
 * the internal `lx.engine.tempo` metronome.
 *
 * TEAudioPattern provides bassRatio and other fields and methods for processing
 * the live audio stream data. Example patterns are preloaded within the Audio
 * Examples workspace project (Select this at the top center of the UI).
 *
 * This pattern demonstrates how to use the audio input within pattern code to
 * activate pixels based on how much bass is currently in the audio, relative
 * to how much has been there recently.
 *
 * An alternate way to do this within the LX Studio UI would be to define a
 * CompoundParameter in this pattern that controls the bar's height, then add
 * a Beat Modulator that is linked to control that height parameter.
 *
 * Be sure to try this pattern with an audio input source selected. In the top
 * left of the UI, click "GLOBAL", enable the Audio with the green top-left toggle,
 * and select an input.
 *
 * If you find it too jumpy, try lengthening the release parameter on the audio
 * GraphicMeter.
